                <p>Since the characteristic $p$ must be prime, we have {'$\\left.p\\middle|{p \\choose k}\\right.$'} for {'$0 < k < p$'} which means {'${p \\choose k} = np = 0$'}. Thus $(a+b)^p = a^p+b^p$.</p>

                <p>Since $p$ is prime, we have {'$\\left.p\\middle|{p^n \\choose k}\\right.$'} for {'$0 < k < p^n$'}. This means that in {'$\\Bbb{F}_p[x]$'} with characteristic $p$,</p>

                <p>Back in {'$\\Bbb{Z}[x]$'}, this implies that all the terms of {'$\\Phi_{p^r}$'} are divisible by the prime $p$ except for the term of the highest degree of {'$p^{r-1}(p-1)$'}. By looking at the terms of smallest degree in the numerator and denominator, we see</p>

                  \\Phi_{p^r}(x+1) = \\frac{(x+1)^{p^r}-1}{(x+1)^{p^{r-1}}-1} = \\frac{\\cdots + p^rx}{\\cdots + p^{r-1}x}.

                <p>Thus the constant term is {'$p^rx/p^{r-1}x = p$'} and is not divisible by $p^2$. By {'$\\text{Eisensteinâ€™s criterion}$'}, {'$\\Phi_{p^r}(x+1)$'} is irreducible, and thus so is {'$\\Phi_{p^r}(x)$'}.</p>

                <p>Suppose $a$ is a unit, and let $ab = 1$. Then $N(a)N(b) = N(1) = 1$. Since $N$ is nonnegative, it must be that $N(a) = N(b) = 1$.</p>
                <p>Suppose $N(a) = 1$, and let {'$a = \\alpha + \\beta\\sqrt{-n}$'}. Since $n > 2$, we must have $\beta^2 = 0$ and also $\alpha^2 = 1$. Thus $a = \pm1$ and $a$ is a unit.</p>

                <p>Let $n$ be odd. Then {'$N(1+\\sqrt{-n}) = 1+n$'} is even.</p>
                <p>Let {'$a = 1+\\sqrt{-n}$'} and {'$b = 1-\\sqrt{-n}$'}. Then $ab = 1+n > 2$ is divisible by $2$, but $2$ does not divide $a$ nor $b$. Thus $2$ is irreducible but not prime, which means {'$\\Bbb{Z}[\\sqrt{-n}]$'} cannot be a UFD.</p>
